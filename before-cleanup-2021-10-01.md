Contains the following files that will be removed during cleanup

- ClaDS2Plus_delayed.cuh  - a version of the ClaDS2 model, which flips a coin during each event giving it some small chance of rare large shift.

- ClaDS2_delayed_optimized-WIP.cuh - contains some code that allows the correct sampling of M samples in the end. This is important and part of this code needs to flow back!

- CombineDS-BUG-Varaince.cuh - a version of CombineDS that I was never able to debug.
